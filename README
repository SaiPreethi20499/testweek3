## SIT737- Cloud Native Application Development  
## 4.1P: Building a simple calculator microservice ##

Overview

This project involves creating a microservice that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using Node.js and Express. Additionally, it includes logging functionality using Winston to capture request details and errors.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Download

Git: Download

Visual Studio Code (or any preferred code editor): Download

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/username/sit737-2025-prac4p.git
cd sit737-2025-prac4p

Step 2: Install Dependencies

npm install express winston

Step 3: Create the Microservice

Create a file named calculator.js.

Add the code seen in 'calculator.js' file.

Step 4: Run the Microservice

To start the application, use the command:

node calculator.js

You should see:

Server running on port 3040

Step 5: Test the Microservice

Open your browser and test endpoints:

Addition Example: http://localhost:3040/calculate?operation=add&num1=5&num2=5

Subtraction Example: http://localhost:3040/calculate?operation=sub&num1=10&num2=5

Step 6: Verify Logs

We can verify the logs in 'combined.log' and 'error.log' files.

Step 7: Push Code to GitHub

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for calculator microservice"
git push origin main
